# Data Science Curriculum

-Note: This is still under construction. - 

### Preliminaries: 

I’ve included freely available online sources where possible. If I’ve included a book that must be purchased, rest assured that it’s worth it. 

Additionally, I found the two following sources very helpful when I was creating my own Data Science Curriculum.

Claudia Gold's http://www.mysliderule.com/learning-paths/data-analysis/learn/ and Clare Corthell's Open Source Data Science Masters at https://github.com/datasciencemasters

### The Curriculum

#### I. Computer Science and Programming

a. General programming knowledge
- 6.01: Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (MIT) 

b. Python

c. R

d. Other topics
- Stanford’s Introduction to Databases

#### II. Statistics and Math
a. A class on statistics
b. A class on probability
c. Linear Algebra — any class should be fine.
d. Differential Equations. 
e. Single and Multi-variable Calculus. 

Schey’s Div, Grad, Curl, and All That’ offers a nice overview of the major topics. I’d recommend this book as a refresher for those who haven’t taken multivariate calculus in some time, or as a supplementary text for those working through a more rigorous primary text. 

I suggest that you use computational tools to work through math problems wherever possible. You can use python’s numpy library 

#### III. Experimental Design and Data Analysis

17.869 Political Science Scope and Methods (MIT)— qualitative research methods, writing, and experimental design
17.871 Political Science Laboratory (MIT) — quantitative research methods
Campbell and Stanley (1963): Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research. don’t be turned off by the fact that this book was written over 50 years ago — the points that it makes are definitely still valid. It’s a small book, but quite concise, and accurately summarizes research design. You should be able to pick up a used copy for around $25. — 

#### IV. Practical stuff
A. A/B testing:
